# Basic Sample Hardhat Project


DEPLOY STATUS : [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/abe8260a-da65-4fc3-a9f1-e1d6d1543d6a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/beamish-fudge-b88d07/deploys)


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
